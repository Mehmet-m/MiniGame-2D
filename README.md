# MiniGame-2D

 In this scenario, you control a character that's colored in red. Within this game world, there's a small map where you'll encounter a number of enemies. The challenge lies in avoiding these enemies because upon contact with them, you'll lose 10 lives.

To defend yourself and navigate through this perilous world, you have the ability to shoot projectiles. By clicking on the screen, you can launch objects, which we'll refer to as 'bullets,' towards the enemies. This action allows you to engage with and overcome the obstacles and adversaries you encounter on your journey.
